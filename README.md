# ML-SickitNearestNeighbors

## Overview
This is the code for a gender classification. It uses the library [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) to create a [K-Nearest-Neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) classifier.
It uses a small dataset of body metrics (height, weight and shoes size) with "male" or "female" label to predict the gender of a given body metrics.

## Dependencies
You need this 3 dependencies to run this program :

* Scikit-learn (http://scikit-learn.org)
* numpy
* scipy

You can install them using pip :
```
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install scikit-learn
```

## Make it works
You can run this script in terminal with this command line :
```
python Male_female.py
```
